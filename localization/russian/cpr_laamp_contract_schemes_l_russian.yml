cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1000.desc: "[employer.GetTitledFirstName] welcomes me to [employer.GetHerHis] private chambers, a smile not quite reaching [employer.GetHerHis] eyes. The room is overly lit by candles, yet somehow remains cold.\n\n'My position affords me many things,' [employer.GetSheHe] says, swirling wine in a goblet. 'Power, wealth, respect... yet I find myself starved for novelty, for distraction from courtly matters.'\n\n[employer.GetSheHe|U] looks at me intently. 'I'm told you possess uncommon talents.

cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1100.desc: "[employer.GetTitledFirstName] nods with interest at my mention of musical talents. 'Music... yes, it has been too long since these chambers heard anything but plotting and petitioning.'\n\n[employer.GetSheHe|U] gestures toward an ornate lute resting on a stand in the corner. 'That instrument has sat silent since the last minstrel passed through. They say music soothes the troubled mind — and mine has troubles enough to drown a kingdom. Show me your skill, if you would. Let me forget, if only for an evening, the weight of my position.'"

# Exceptional Success (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1101.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Symphony of the Soul"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1101.desc: "The lute feels alive in my hands, an extension of my own voice as I coax melodies that drift through [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] chambers like ghosts of happier times. I begin with court favorites, then slowly transition to rarer tunes — ballads from [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] lands and haunting rhythms carried along trade routes from distant shores.\n\nI notice [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] fingers first tapping in time, then [employer.GetHerHis] lips moving silently with half-remembered lyrics. When I shift to a childhood lullaby common in these lands, I glimpse a moment of unguarded emotion cross [employer.GetHerHis] face.\n\nBy the time the final note fades, hanging in the air like morning mist, [employer.GetTitledFirstName] sits in contented silence, transformed by the experience."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1101.desc.outro: "\n\n'It has been too long since these walls heard anything but plotting and petitions,' [employer.GetSheHe] says finally, voice softer than before. 'You have given me a gift beyond mere entertainment — you have reminded me of beauty.'\n\n[employer.GetSheHe|U] presents me with a purse that jingles pleasingly with coin. 'Worth every denier, and then some.'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1101.a: "The music speaks what words cannot."

# Success (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1102.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Pleasing Melodies"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1102.desc: "Though I am no master, my fingers find the right notes more often than not. I play simple, pleasing melodies that gradually draw [employer.GetTitledFirstName] out of [employer.GetHerHis] melancholy.\n\nWhen I stumble over a particularly difficult passage, I cover it with a flourish and a smile. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] seems not to notice — or perhaps chooses not to comment — as [employer.GetSheHe] is carried away by the simple joy of music filling [employer.GetHerHis] chambers."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1102.desc.outro: "\n\n'That was... refreshing,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] says as the final notes fade. 'It is good to be reminded of simple pleasures.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] signals for a servant who brings forward my payment — modest but fair for the entertainment provided."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1102.a: "Even imperfect music can lift the spirits."

# Follower Success
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1103.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: A Master's Touch"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1103.desc: "I present [follower.GetTitledFirstName], who bows with practiced grace before taking up position with [follower.GetHerHis] instrument. What follows can only be described as enchantment through sound. Notes cascade like water, build like storm clouds, and dance like flame, all guided by [follower.GetFirstNamePossessive] masterful touch.\n\n[employer.GetTitledFirstName] sits transfixed, occasionally closing [employer.GetHerHis] eyes to better absorb the melody. By the performance's end, the hard lines of authority have softened on [employer.GetHerHis] face."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1103.desc.outro: "\n\n'Your [follower.GetTitledFirstName] has a rare gift,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] acknowledges. 'To think such talent travels in your company!' [employer.GetSheHe|U] rewards us generously, clearly pleased with the arrangement."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1103.a: "True talent deserves recognition."

# Success (Intrigue)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1104.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: A Different Tune"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1104.desc: "I begin to play, but my true performance lies in my observation of [employer.GetTitledFirstName]. I notice how [employer.GetHerHis] eyes linger on certain objects, how [employer.GetHerHis] posture shifts when I mention certain topics between songs.\n\nGradually, I weave conversations into my performance, drawing out [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] interests and concerns. The music becomes secondary to the connection I'm establishing — one where [employer.GetSheHe] feels truly heard, perhaps for the first time in years.\n\nBy the time I set down the instrument, [employer.GetTitledFirstName] is speaking freely of matters I suspect are rarely shared, believing [employer.GetSheHe] has found a sympathetic ear rather than recognizing my careful extraction of valuable information."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1104.desc.outro: "\n\n'I had not expected such... understanding from a mere entertainer,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] admits, seemingly unaware of how much [employer.GetSheHe] has revealed. 'You have a gift for more than music.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] pays me well, perhaps hoping for future conversations — unaware of the advantage I've gained through this seemingly simple performance."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1104.a: "Sometimes the most valuable notes are those left unplayed."

# Failure (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1105.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Discordant Notes"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1105.desc: "I had overestimated my musical abilities. What began as ambitious quickly devolved into embarrassment as my fingers fumbled over strings and my voice cracked on notes beyond my range.\n\nI tried to recover with simpler melodies, but by then [employer.GetTitledFirstName] had already begun exchanging pained glances with [employer.GetHerHis] attendants. When I accidentally snapped a string mid-performance, the sharp twang seemed to echo my failure throughout the chamber.\n\n'Perhaps that's... enough for tonight,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] suggests diplomatically, though [employer.GetHerHis] grimace betrays [employer.GetHerHis] true feelings. 'I find I am more fatigued than I realized.'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1105.desc.outro: "\n\nThere is no payment offered, only a swift dismissal and the burning shame of a performance best forgotten. As I depart, I overhear a courtier whisper, 'And to think we expected entertainment worthy of our [employer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1105.a: "Some talents are better left unclaimed."

# Failure (Intrigue)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1106.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: A Discord of Intentions"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1106.desc: "I begin to play, focusing more on observing [employer.GetTitledFirstName] than on the music itself. My fingers hit discordant notes as I search for vulnerabilities or secrets I might exploit.\n\nMy distraction becomes increasingly obvious as the melody falls apart. I attempt to cover the musical failures with clever conversation, but [employer.GetTitledFirstName]'s expression hardens with each probing question I interject between faltering notes.\n\n'I believe,' [employer.GetSheHe] finally states, raising a hand to silence my performance, 'that you are more interested in matters beyond your contract. Do you think me a fool to be so easily manipulated?'\n\nThe atmosphere in the chamber chills instantly. What I had intended as subtle information gathering has been perceived as invasive and disrespectful."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1106.desc.outro: "\n\n'You may leave now,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] dismisses me coldly. 'I have no use for entertainers who seek to pry rather than perform.' Not only is payment withheld, but I leave having made an enemy who now watches me with heightened suspicion."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1106.a: "My subtlety needs considerable refinement."

# 2. Poetry Recitation Contract
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Words to Stir the Soul"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.desc: "'Poetry...' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] considers thoughtfully. 'The court bards offer empty flatteries, but true poetry — that which speaks to the heart's condition — is rare in these halls.'\n\n[employer.GetSheHe|U] settles into [employer.GetHerHis] chair, swirling wine in a goblet. 'Bring me tales of distant lands, verses that stir the soul. Let your words paint pictures my eyes may never see, speak truths courtiers dare not utter. Show me your mastery of language, if you truly possess it.'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.a: "I shall weave words to captivate your mind and heart." # Diplomacy Challenge

# Tooltips
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.a.tt.success: "Your verses captivate [employer.GetTitledFirstName], transporting [employer.GetHerHim] beyond the confines of [employer.GetHerHis] position. Your payment will be generous, and your reputation for artistry enhanced."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.a.tt.failure: "Your poetic efforts fall flat, boring or confusing [employer.GetTitledFirstName]. You will receive no payment, and your reputation as a wordsmith suffers."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1200.b.tt.success: "Your scholarly approach to poetry impresses [employer.GetTitledFirstName], who appreciates both beauty and intellectual depth. You receive payment and gain respect for your erudition."

# Exceptional Success (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1201.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Verses Like Spellcraft"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1201.desc: "I begin with verses of my own creation, carefully crafted to flatter without appearing obsequious. As [employer.GetTitledFirstName] relaxes, I transition to epic poems of heroes whose circumstances mirror [employer.GetHerHis] own struggles, subtly emphasizing their ultimate triumphs.\n\nMy voice rises and falls with practiced cadence, painting pictures with words alone. I sprinkle in philosophical musings from eastern sages, bawdy couplets that draw unexpected laughter, and tender sonnets that speak to the heart's quiet yearnings.\n\nBy the time I finish with a stirring ode to legacy and remembrance, [employer.GetTitledFirstName] leans forward, completely absorbed in the worlds I've conjured from thin air."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1201.desc.outro: "\n\n'In all my years,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] says when the final verse ends, 'few have shown me worlds so vivid without leaving this chamber. You have a rare gift.'\n\n[employer.GetSheHe|U] signals to a servant who brings forward not just coin, but a small token of appreciation — a ring bearing [employer.GetHerHis] house symbol. 'That you might remember this evening as fondly as I shall.'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1201.a: "Words, like seeds, may bloom in unexpected places."

# Success (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1202.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Tales Well Told"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1202.desc: "Though not all my rhymes flow perfectly, the stories I weave capture [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] imagination. I recite tales of valor and romance collected during my travels, adapting them slightly to better resonate with my audience.\n\nWhen I falter momentarily in remembering a particular verse, I improvise with convincing confidence. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] nods appreciatively at a clever turn of phrase, seemingly content with my modest talents."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1202.desc.outro: "\n\n'You have a gift for storytelling,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] acknowledges when I conclude. 'It has been a pleasant diversion.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] provides fair payment for my efforts, clearly satisfied if not entirely transported by the experience."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1202.a: "Even simple words can paint a thousand pictures."

# Follower Success

cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1203.desc: "[follower.GetTitledFirstName] steps forward with the quiet confidence of one who has performed before royalty. As [follower.GetSheHe] begins to speak, the very air seems to still in reverence to [follower.GetHerHis] words.\n\nProse becomes music, and poetry becomes truth as [follower.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] weaves tales that transport [employer.GetTitledFirstName] far beyond the confines of [employer.GetHerHis] position. I watch with pride as my companion demonstrates the power of language wielded by a true master."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1203.desc.outro: "\n\n'Your [follower.GetTitledFirstName] possesses true artistry,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] declares when the recitation concludes. 'You choose your companions wisely.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] rewards us generously, clearly moved by [follower.GetFirstNamePossessive] performance."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1203.a: "A master's words carry weight beyond their sound."

# Success (Learning)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1204.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Scholar's Verses"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1204.desc: "Rather than rely solely on entertainment value, I draw on my scholarly knowledge to present verses with historical and philosophical depth. I recite ancient poems in their original tongues before translating, explaining the cultural contexts that give them deeper meaning.\n\nI compare rhetorical techniques across traditions, noting how certain metaphors transcend cultural boundaries. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] engages intellectually, asking questions that reveal [employer.GetHerHis] own education — a side [employer.GetSheHe] perhaps rarely has opportunity to display.\n\nWhat begins as recitation evolves into scholarly discourse, with poetry as its foundation. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] seems to appreciate being treated as a mind worth engaging rather than merely an audience to be diverted."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1204.desc.outro: "\n\n'Most entertainers assume I desire only distraction,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] confides as our session concludes. 'You recognized a hunger for substance as well as beauty.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] compensates me well, with a look that suggests [employer.GetSheHe] will remember this encounter differently from most."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1204.a: "True poetry enlightens as it entertains."

# Failure (Diplomacy)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1205.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Empty Verses"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1205.desc: "I had prepared what I thought were moving verses, but from the moment I began, I could sense [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] attention drifting. My carefully selected poems — perhaps too scholarly or too foreign for local tastes — fell flat in the space between us.\n\nWorse still, I found myself repeating sections I had already recited, my mind blanking at crucial moments. What should have been a captivating journey through words became an awkward trudge through increasingly confused narratives.\n\n[employer.GetTitledFirstName] attempted politeness at first, nodding at appropriate intervals, but eventually began glancing toward the door with undisguised longing."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1205.desc.outro: "\n\n'I believe we've had quite enough... culture for one evening,' [employer.GetSheHe] finally interrupts, making no attempt to hide a yawn. 'Court business calls early tomorrow.'\n\nNo coin exchanges hands, and it's clear that my name will not be mentioned favorably in this court's gossip."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1205.a: "Words failed me when I needed them most."

# Failure (Learning)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1206.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Scholarly Pretensions"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1206.desc: "I attempt to elevate my recitation with scholarly references and philosophical insights, hoping to impress [employer.GetTitledFirstName] with intellectual depth rather than mere artistic expression. My verses become weighted with citations of ancient texts and complex theological concepts.\n\nAs I expound on the metaphysical implications of a particularly obscure simile, I notice [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] attention wandering. What I intended as profound discourse has become tedious pedantry, the poetry buried beneath layers of academic posturing.\n\n'I believe,' [employer.GetSheHe] finally interrupts with thinly veiled impatience, 'that I requested entertainment, not a lecture. Perhaps you misunderstood the nature of our arrangement?'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1206.desc.outro: "\n\n'That will be all for tonight,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] dismisses me with a wave, barely concealing a yawn. 'Next time, I shall be more specific in requesting someone who understands the difference between recitation and dissertation.' I depart without payment, my scholarly approach having thoroughly failed to provide the diversion sought."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1206.a: "Knowledge without artistry is merely information."

cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1300.desc: "[employer.GetTitledFirstName] raises an eyebrow at my mention of dance.

[employer.GetTitledFirstName] watches with curiosity as I prepare, then signal for the musicians [employer.GetSheHe] has provided to begin.\n\nMy first movements are controlled and precise — the formal patterns favored in noble courts across the realm. But as [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] interest grows, I gradually incorporate elements from dances I've learned in my travels: the passionate spins of Iberian courts, the hypnotic hand gestures of eastern temples, the earthy vigor of common festivals.\n\nMy body speaks a language beyond words, telling stories of passion, loss, triumph, and devotion. I see [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] breath quicken at moments of tension, [employer.GetHerHis] smile widen during playful sequences."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1301.desc.outro: "\n\nWhen the final notes fade and the dance concludes, [employer.GetTitledFirstName] applauds with genuine enthusiasm — perhaps the first sincere emotion [employer.GetSheHe] has displayed since my arrival.\n\n'For a time, I forgot my station and all its burdens,' [employer.GetSheHe] admits, color high in [employer.GetHerHis] cheeks. 'A rare gift indeed.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] rewards me generously, the heavy purse a testament to how thoroughly [employer.GetSheHe] was transported by the performance."

cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1602.desc: "I present a series of illusions and minor deceptions that, while not flawless, still manage to bewilder and entertain [employer.GetTitledFirstName] and the small audience [employer.GetSheHe] has gathered. What I lack in technical perfection, I compensate for with theatrical flair.\n\nWhen a trick nearly fails, I incorporate the mistake into the performance, convincing all present that the apparent error was itself part of a larger deception. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] applauds my recovery, perhaps more impressed by my quick thinking than [employer.GetSheHe] would have been by flawless execution."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1602.desc.outro: "\n\n'Most entertaining,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] pronounces when my final illusion concludes. 'A welcome diversion from the predictable amusements of court.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] provides fair payment, clearly satisfied with the evening's entertainment."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1602.a: "Perception is easily guided by expectation."

# Follower Success
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1603.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Master of Deception"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1603.desc: "I present [follower.GetTitledFirstName], whose skills in illusion and deception far surpass my own. With elegant precision and captivating presence, [follower.GetSheHe] performs feats that seem to defy the very laws of nature.\n\nObjects appear and vanish, thoughts are seemingly plucked from minds, predictions materialize with impossible accuracy. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] watches with childlike wonder as [follower.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] transforms the mundane chamber into a place where the impossible becomes reality, if only for an evening."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1603.desc.outro: "\n\n'Extraordinary,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] breathes when the final illusion concludes. 'Your [follower.GetTitledFirstName] possesses talents that border on the supernatural.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] rewards us generously, clearly spellbound by the performance [employer.GetSheHe] has witnessed."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1603.a: "True mastery makes the impossible seem inevitable."

cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1604.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Philosophical Deceptions"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1604.desc: "Rather than focus solely on spectacle, I present my illusions as demonstrations of philosophical principles — how easily perception can be misled, how firmly we trust our senses despite their fallibility.\n\nBetween tricks, I offer insights from ancient scholars on the nature of reality and perception, transforming simple deceptions into explorations of deeper truths. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] engages not merely as an audience to be amazed but as a mind to be stimulated.\n\nBy framing each illusion within a context of intellectual inquiry, I elevate what could have been mere entertainment into a scholarly journey that flatters [employer.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] intelligence while still providing the wonder [employer.GetSheHe] sought."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1604.desc.outro: "\n\n'You've given me not just amusement but food for thought,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] acknowledges when the performance ends. 'A rare combination indeed.' [employer.GetSheHe|U] compensates me well, with a respect that suggests [employer.GetSheHe] values the intellectual framework as much as the illusions themselves."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1604.a: "The greatest deception is not what fools the eyes, but what challenges the mind."

# Failure (Intrigue)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1605.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: The Trick Revealed"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1605.desc: "My performance begins well enough, with simple illusions drawing appropriate gasps from [employer.GetTitledFirstName] and the assembled courtiers. Emboldened by this early success, I attempt a more complex deception — one requiring careful preparation and timing.\n\nDisaster strikes when a hidden mechanism fails at the crucial moment, exposing the mundane method behind my supposed magic. A courtier points and laughs, others soon joining in as my performance collapses into embarrassment.\n\nWorse still, in my flustered state, I accidentally reveal another prepared trick, making it painfully obvious that what I presented as mysterious insight was merely careful preparation and theatrical contrivance."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1605.desc.outro: "\n\n'I think we've seen enough of these... parlor tricks,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] says, making no attempt to hide [employer.GetHerHis] disappointment. 'Perhaps next time I shall hire a child's birthday performer instead.'\n\nI am dismissed without payment, my reputation for clever deception thoroughly undermined by very real failure."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1605.a: "An illusionist exposed is merely a fool with props."

# Failure (Learning)
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1606.t: "$cpr_laamp_1000_contract$: Philosopher's Folly"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1606.desc: "Rather than focus on spectacle, I attempt to frame my modest illusions as demonstrations of profound philosophical principles. Between simple tricks, I launch into elaborate explanations about perception, reality, and the fallibility of human senses.\n\nMy scholarly digressions grow increasingly lengthy while my actual illusions remain rudimentary. [employer.GetTitledFirstName] shifts impatiently as what should be an entertaining display becomes an impromptu lecture on epistemology.\n\n'Yes, yes,' [employer.GetSheHe] finally interrupts my discourse on how a vanishing coin represents the transience of material wealth, 'most fascinating. But I had rather hoped to be amazed, not educated. Can you perhaps perform an illusion without explaining it to death?'"
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1606.desc.outro: "\n\n'I believe we've had enough philosophy for one evening,' [employer.GetTitledFirstName] concludes when I begin yet another theoretical explanation. 'Next time I desire a lecture, I shall visit the monastery.' I am dismissed without payment, having thoroughly failed to understand that entertainment requires wonder, not merely intellectual understanding."
cpr_laamp_contract_schemes.1606.a: "Some mysteries are better left unexplained."
