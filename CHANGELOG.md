## Version 0.1.1

### Localization

* Added Chinese translation by **@Dark_Crow**.

## Version 0.1.0

### Decisions

* Improved the *Moonlight as a Prostitute* and *Stop Moonlighting as a Prostitute* Carnalitas decisions and enabled them for AI rulers.
* Improved the *Visit a Brothel* stress-coping vanilla decision for *Rakish* characters and its related events so that they now involve an actual *Prostitute* character and have a much lower chance for STD.

### Interactions

* Improved *Start Prostitution* and *Stop Prostitution* Carnalitas interactions and enabled them for AI rulers.
* Rebalanced the prices and stress effects for having sex with a prostitute via the Carnalitas *Make Love* interaction.

### Events

* Improved existing Carnalitas prostitution events.
* Changed the following vanilla events to involve *Prostitute* characters: *The Hippodrome's Refreshments* (`chariot_race.4030`), *Outside the Walls* (`tour_travel.3140`), *House of Pleasure*, (`tour_travel.3007`).
* Added a hidden event for non-ruler *Prostitute* characters to decide to start or stop working as prostitutes.
* Added spawning additional *Prostitute* characters every year.

### Miscellaneous

* Improved the conditions for being able to work as a prostitute, and the AI willingness to do so.
* Reduced the STD chances in both vanilla and Carnalitas content.
* Having sex with a prostitute may result in secrets being learned by either of the partners.
